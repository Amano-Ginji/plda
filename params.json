{"name":"Plda","tagline":"Parallel C++ implementation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation ","body":"plda is a parallel C++ implementation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (1,2).  We are expecting to present a highly optimized parallel implemention of the Gibbs sampling algorithm for the training/inference of LDA (3).  The carefully designed architecture is expected to support extensions of this algorithm.\r\n\r\nWe will release an enhanced parallel implementation of LDA, named as PLDA+ (2), which can improve scalability of LDA by signiﬁcantly reducing the unparallelizable communication bottleneck and achieve good load balancing.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to publish any work based on plda, please cite our paper as:\r\n\r\nZhiyuan Liu, Yuzhou Zhang, Edward Y.
